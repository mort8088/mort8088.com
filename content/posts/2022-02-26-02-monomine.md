This month's contribution to my One Game a Month 2022 challenge is MonoMine a quick copy of the windows classic.

This month I put a little more effort into this because this game actually has game states like win and lose and actually gives some instruction to the player at the end of the game.

With such amazing Special effects as text with drop shadowing and on the end screen if you placed a flag correctly on a mine it'll be coloured green and if not it'll be coloured a burnt orange.
