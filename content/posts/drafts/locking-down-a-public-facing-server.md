From the moment you stand up a public-facing server on the internet it's a race between you trying to secure it against attack and the rest of the world trying to break in and take control from you, so what can you do?

For this example, I'll be securing a Linode server, if you want to try out their offering you can get a $100, 60-day credit by following this <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=fdcaaa93951a6623d02f2e27276a8c4a2a350611">link</a> and signing up for an account *(credit available once a valid payment method is added to your new account)*
