If it doesn't rain it pores. after we got back from Cardiff last week we started feeling quite ruff and if you read the February review you;ll know I caught COViD, so this weeks been a little sleepy. but I did start working on my new homeLab sever or more accurately finding out that the old PC I was going to use is not fit for porpoise.

I was going to use an old AMD x2 I had in a cupboard gathering dust, but it turns out that it's so old I can't get Ubuntu server to install on it.

Not to be undone I've reinstalled the old DELL Inspiron Laptop I've been tinkering with, and plan to install HomeLabOS on it to manage the services.
