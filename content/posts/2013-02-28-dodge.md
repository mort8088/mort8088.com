Dodge is a turn-based puzzle game that I have released in various forms since 1992 and have finally got around to releasing an up to date version.

In the game, you are a little guy who is being chased by creeps. The idea is to kill all these creeps either by getting them to walk on a landmine or getting trampled by the Grim Reaper which turns up on Level 10. You can move in any intercardinal direction, warp to a random free square or standstill. Control by using the numeric keypad or the onscreen arrows.
