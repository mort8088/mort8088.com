Our regular characters from [Halloween Defense][1] are back in a fun little match 3 game.

The monsters have been caught and are being held in glass jars.  Your job is to match up 3 or more of these guys to release them from their glass prisons.

You have to be quick though because if you don't clear these monsters from their glass jars quick enough and they reach the top then it's game over.
