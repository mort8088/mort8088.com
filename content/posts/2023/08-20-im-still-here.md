Hello,

It's been a quiet week this week. We made a quick run down to Wales to see Mum in the hospital. She seems to be okay but looks tired, and everything seems to be too much effort for her. I have a follow-up appointment for my CPAP machine tomorrow, but I've had issues keeping the damn thing on at night. It's just the most bothersome thing ever.

We watched "[Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2906216/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_Dung)" last night. I thought it was funny and worth the watch. ðŸ™‚ We also watched "[SMILE](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15474916/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_q_SMIL)," and it was good. It reminded me of "[It Follows](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_IT%2520FOLLOWS)" and "[The Ring](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_The%2520Ring)" â€” supernatural things that will kill you unless you can figure out how to pass it on to someone else, Que the moral dilemma. The thing is, I'm not a big fan of horror films, which is odd because I used to be. I think I just lost interest in them.

I've started working on my maze game again. I put it on hold for ages, but I keep thinking about it, so I really want to try and get a feature-complete version done to see if it could go anywhere.

Anyway, how are things with you?
