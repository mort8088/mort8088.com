## ‚úçÔ∏è Website

Getting Covid after going to the funeral last month I lost all oomph for doing ***anything*** which included writing for the site so around the 24th I decided to just write up the month round up and start again next month afresh, so here we go :smile:

## üçø Watching

We caught the last season of "[Endeavour](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2701582)" on [ITVX](https://www.itv.com) this month and from that got the idea to watch the old episodes of "[Inspector Morse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092379/)" which is good just very dated now :smirk:. I spend so much time doing things like pointing at the screen and saying "Look a real train not like the crap you get now" and "He's getting upset over paying ¬£1.92 for ***2*** Pints of beer!?! That's 96p a pint!". It's like watching a time capsule into my childhood seeing as it was filmed from the late '80s through the '90s

Haven't had time to watch any films though this month because the episodes of Mores are about 2 hours each it doesn't leave much time for our normal TV watching let alone adding films in to that as well.

## üéÆ Gaming

Caught up with the lads for [Golf](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431240/Golf_With_Your_Friends/) this month, and we've been playing some more [CS:GO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/), and all before they made the [CS2 announcement](https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/3716071937633222892) which I have to say is making me just a little bit excited :grin::nerd_face::bangbang:

I also picked up "[Aliens: Fireteam Elite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1549970/Aliens_Fireteam_Elite/)" in the Steam sale but I've only played an hour of it and it's not performing as well as I'd hoped with sub 30 FPS it's hard to get into. Though I do agree with people that have compared it to "L4D" so it might be worth trying to get the performance sorted out.

Seeing how my get up and go, got up and f**ked off, I haven't done *any* game development, I did halfheartedly look at Godot Game engine but I'm still not convinced. I might need to spend more time with it.

## üìö Reading

Still failing to make time to read anything dead-tree based, though I have been spending my evening TV watching time listening to the TV while I read news sites and RSS feeds I've subscribed.

To that ends I can heartily recommend "[Cory Doctorow's craphound.com](https://craphound.com/feed/)" RSS feed.

## üçÑ Life

The month started badly with recovering from Covid and then I had to go to a consult with the cardiologist about getting my AF[^1] sorted so I got booked in for a pre-op consultation where they checked I was healthy enough to shock my heart back to Sinus rhythm and to make sure I understand that I have to take my blood-thinners for the next few weeks without missing any or they can't do the procedure. It's going to be only the second time I've had to have a general anaesthetic but apparently I should only be out for 15 minuets.

I did start working on a new homeLab sever or more accurately finding out that the old PC I was going to use is not fit for porpoise. I was going to use an AMD x2 I had in a cupboard gathering dust, but it turns out that it's so old I can't get Ubuntu server to install on it. Not to be undone I reinstalled the DELL Inspiron Laptop I've been tinkering with, and planed to install HomeLabOS on it to manage the services. but this too was thwarted when I realized that it was a buggy mess that I just couldn't get to install let alone run.

So, one scorched earth re-install later, I had [Docker](https://www.docker.com) running [Yacht](https://yacht.sh) that I used to install [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) for my media server, [YacY](https://yacy.net/index.html) for search and [Heimdall](https://heimdall.site/) for my home page. then I messed up a few things and killed everything by mistake. So I'm back to square one, and putting off starting over again. But I haven't lost hope and one day in the not too distant future I'll get things sorted and then I can post a guide to provisioning a homelab server, at the very leased how I got mine up and running.

Work is going ok, I appear to be on track to get my end of year bonus next month, and there is talk of raises in the offing, which is nice.

I've also been thinking about moving on from using Linux Mint but I've always stuck with it because it is so close to the windows way of doing things that I grew up using. At the moment I'm looking at going over to Debian 11 because I can switch DE[^2] easily and it's a stable system, no rolling releases for me, I just want a system that works and I guess that I just love the apt package manager.

I haven't lost as much weight as I'd wanted to this month, but I have lost some, so I might have to start exercising as well as watching what I eat.

Desktop GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files, while they usually do not provide access to all of the features found in the underlying operating system.
