## ‚úçÔ∏è Website

I've been hard at work working on my homelab series writing up how-to guides on every stage of building a homelab server with docker but also how to make it more secure from being hacked currently I have the first three published [Install Ubuntu Server](/homelab/ubuntu-server/), [Post install configuration](/homelab/server-lockdown/), [Adding An External Data HDD](/homelab/ext-data-hdd/). and I'm working on the docker and docker compose pages now. I don't profess to be an expert in this area but it's something I want to have at home, and I'm always having to look up how to do things and what commands I need that having my own notes makes finding the answer easier if it's on my own site.

## üçø Watching

We managed to watch a few films this month:-

1. [Avatar: The Way of Water](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1630029/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_q_avatar)

    Unlike the first Avatar film this just felt like any other modern sci-fi film. don't get me wrong it's a good film but it's nothing special when the first one came out it was beyond cutting edge SFX which made up for the *"It's Pocahontas with blue people!"* but this time the story was better but the SFX hadn't got much better. It's worth watching as a continuation of the story but but it's not going to blow you away.

2. [DC League of Superpets](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8912936/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_super%2520pets)

    Ok this was funny, a little diabetics inducing towards the end but still funny.

3. [Nope](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_Nope)

    Jordan Peele does it again, with an awesome take on UFO abduction / Alien killing, I watched the trailer and I was sold. If you don't respect creatures, you'll end up getting hurt. That's one of the obvious things the film is going for, pulling together what seems like unrelated story lines in the horses and chimp. I was glad they didn't fully explain the alien, which make it scarier but when they did bring the alien full into the screen it was done really well and felt like it could actually exist in the world. Worth watching.

4. [Peter Pan & Wendy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5635026/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_0_q_Peter%2520and%2520wendy)

    Based on J. M. Barrie's novel Peter and Wendy and inspired by the 1953 animated classic, Peter Pan and Wendy is the timeless tale of a young girl who, defying her parents' wishes to attend boarding school, travels with her two younger brothers to the magical Neverland. Meh if you like that sort of thing great kids will love it but I never liked Peter Pan because I always felt he was completely unlikeable as a character I just don't get what people see in it.

And since the wife keeps looking for something to watch while I'm working on stuff she's ben re-watching [Bones](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460627/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_q_Bones) from the beginning and when we run out of stuff to watch at night I end up joining her, I almost forgot how good it was.

## üéÆ Gaming

I've gone back to playing [Oxygen not included](https://www.klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included). I seem to like the base building aspect of the game so mutch that I've never got off world and I know there are so many areas of the game I'm missing out on because I keep killing off my base. but I still keep going back to it. I like it just the way I play it üôÇ.

## üìö Reading

I've also started my library pages that I hope will be a nice reference for the books I've read and a way to encourage people to read more, I was told I was dyslexic at a young age and have always found it hard to not only make time for reading but I have an amazingly slow reading speed. I remember when I first tried to make a point of reading a book that was not for school it was [Watchers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1206357) by Dean R. Koontz and it took me almost a year to get through it, I carried that book everywhere with me. I've got better, but it also takes me an ice age to find time to actually pick up a book and read it, but when I do it is something I enjoy, it's the getting started that I find hard. Anyway I'm aiming to read at least three books by the end of the year... *yeah I know set the bar low*.

## üçÑ Life

Apart from researching and trying to write for the site, this month has been fairly uneventful, we had some bank holidays and I took some time off for my cardioversion recovery and a quick visit to see mum in south wales. I got my bonus from work and that cleared off my last outstanding loan so the current [cost-of-living crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%93present_United_Kingdom_cost-of-living_crisis) is lessened a bit because I'm not paying that off anymore. Apparently there is a pneumonia vaccination and because of all the things that are wrong with my insides I qualify for it. So in my continued quest to take all the free drugs I can get from the government I had that one too. I have gained back most of the weight I had lost this year, but I'm already working on getting that shifted again.
