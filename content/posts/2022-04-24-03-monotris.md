I finally got around to finishing March&#8217;s contribution to my One Game a Month 2022 challenge Monotris is a copy of the classic Tetris.

I put a little more into this month&#8217;s game, like game states, win and lose and local High Score as well as some instruction to the player at the end of the game.

And a dash of juice with the score spinning up to the new value.
