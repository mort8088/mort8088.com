I finally got around to finishing March's contribution to my One Game a Month 2022 challenge Monotris is a copy of the classic Tetris.

I put a little more into this month's game, like game states, win and lose and local High Score as well as some instruction to the player at the end of the game.

And a dash of juice with the score spinning up to the new value.
