I'm a dyslexic software engineer and reading has always been a bit of a chore, with the exception of a few authors.

I've set myself the goal of reading three books this year, preferably ones I haven't read before. ðŸ˜‰

Here are my book reports :-

## 2023

<!-- - [Cory Doctorow - red team blues](/books/cory-doctorow_red-team-blues/) <!-- -->
- Cory Doctorow - red team blues (***Currently Reading***) <!-- -->
