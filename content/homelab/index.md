In this series, I will provide you with a comprehensive guide to installing and setting up a homelab using Ubuntu and Docker. By building containers to self-host a range of useful applications, you can experiment with different technologies and configurations in a flexible and scalable way. This approach can help you find solutions to replace privacy-invading big tech services that you may feel dependent on.

I will walk you through the process step by step, covering all aspects of the setup, including installation, configuration, and troubleshooting. With my guidance, you'll be able to create a homelab that meets your unique needs and preferences.

So, whether you're interested in learning new skills, improving your online privacy, or simply having more control over your data, my homelab guide can help you get started.
