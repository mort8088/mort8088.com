description: "Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows developers to define a set of services and their dependencies in a single file, which can then be used to build and start the entire application stack with a single command. Docker Compose also provides features like scaling, networking, and environment variables to make it easier to manage complex applications."

With Docker installed we can move on to getting familiar with Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly by checking the version.

```Bash
docker compose version
Docker Compose version vN.N.N
```

Where vN.N.N is placeholder text standing in for the latest version, at time of writing it is *v2.17.2*.
